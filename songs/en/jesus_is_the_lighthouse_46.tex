% section #1: verse 

\beginverse
There’s a \[D]lighthouse on the hillside 
\[D7]that \[G]overlooks life's \[D]sea,
When I’m tossed it sends out a lig\[E9/B]ht,
tha\[E7]t I might \[A]see;
\[A7]And the \[D]light that shines in \[D7]darkness, 
now wi\[Em7]ll safely lead us \[E7]o’er,
\[A7]If it w\[D]asn’t for the lighthouse,
\[D7 G]my ship would \[G/A A7 D]be no more.
\endverse

% section #2: verse 

\beginverse
Ev’ry\[D]body that lives about us \[D7]says, 
“\[G]Tear that lighthouse \[D]down
The big ships don’t sail this way \[E9/B]anymore, 
\[E7]There’s no use of it standing \[A]‘round”;
\[A7]Then my \[D]mind goes back to that \[D7]stormy night,
when just \[Em7]in time I saw the \[E7]light,
\[A7]Yes, the \[D]light from that old lighthouse 
\[D7 G]that stands up there on \[G/A A7 D]the hill.
\endverse

% section #2: chorus 

\beginchorus
And I thank\[D] God \[A7]for the \[G/D]ligh\[D]thouse\[D9G], 
I owe my life \[Gm6 D]to Him,
For Jesus \[A7]is the \[G/D D]lighthouse, 
and \[E9]from \[E7]the rocks of \[A]sin;
\[D]He has shone a \[A7]light \[G/D]around \[D]me 
\[D9]that I\[G] could clea\[Gm6 D]rly see,
If it \[D]wasn’t for the lighthouse\[A7], 
where would this sh\[D]ip be? (repeat)
\endchorus
